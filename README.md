# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a conjoint degree in Computer Science and Classical Studies and Ancient History
- I am taking STATS 220 because I previously took stats 101 and found the course interesting
- I am interested in learning about the how to use different data technologies to solve specfic problems
