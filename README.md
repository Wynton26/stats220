Welcome to my **STATS 220** repository!  

## About Me  

I am currently pursuing a **conjoint degree** in:

### Why I'm Taking STATS 220  

1. I previously took STATS 101 and found it really interesting.  
2. I want to explore data technologies and how they can be used to solve real-world problems.  
3. Learning to communicate data effectively is a valuable skill.
